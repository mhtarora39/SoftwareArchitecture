[Housing](Housing.cpp):
Along one side of a road there is a sequence of vacant
plots of land. Each plot has a different area (non-zero).
So,The area of the sequence A[1] , A[2] .... A[N]

You want to buy K acres of land to build a house. You want
to find all segments of continuous plots (i.e., a subsection
in the sequence) of whose sum is exactly K.

[Unique Substring](UniqueSubStr.cpp):</br>
Given a string s, find the length of the longest 
substring
 without repeating characters.
 Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"</br>
Output: 3</br>
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with</br> the length of 3.</br>
Example 2:</br>
</br>
Input: s = "bbbbb"
</br>
Output: 1
</br>
Explanation: The answer is "b", with 
</br>
the length of 1.
</br>
Example 3:
</br>
Input: s = "pwwkew"
</br>
Output: 3
</br>
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with 
</br>
the length of 3.
</br>
Notice that the answer must be a 
</br>
substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
</br> 

Constraints:
</br>
0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
</br>
s consists of English letters, digits, 
</br>
symbols and spaces.
