# String Solved Problems:
* [Replace space with %20](replace20.cpp) : Write a method to replace all the spaces in a string with ‘%20’. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters and that you are given the “true” length of the string.
* [Generate All the subsequence] (Subsequence.cpp) : Generate all the sub sequence of the given string. i.e 

given string: abcd
subsequence : a,b,c,d,ab,ac,ad,bc,bd,cd,abc,acd,abd,bcd,abcd
* [Sort Substring](SortString.cpp) : Write a program to sort entire string with below mentioned structure.
1) String consist of digits and spaces.
2) This is consistent spacing between digits. i.e "21 33 34"
3) Each digit refereed as columns from left to right as 1,2 .... N i.e  In "21 33 34" 21 is Column Number 1 , Column Number 2 , Column Number 3 etc.

We have to sort the string based on column number.
i.e If input strings are 

S1 : "21 33 34"
S2 : "33 11 91"
S3 : "01 01 01"

column 1 ( i.e 33 for S1 , 11 for S2 and 01 for S3)

Answer:
S3 S1 S2
