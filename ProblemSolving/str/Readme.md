# String Solved Problems:
* [Replace space with %20](replace20.cpp) : Write a method to replace all the spaces in a string with ‘%20’. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters and that you are given the “true” length of the string.
* [Generate All the subsequence] (Subsequence.cpp) : Generate all the sub sequence of the given string. i.e 

given string: abcd
subsequence : a,b,c,d,ab,ac,ad,bc,bd,cd,abc,acd,abd,bcd,abcd
