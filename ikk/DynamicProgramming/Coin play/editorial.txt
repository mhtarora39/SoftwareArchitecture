Recursive solution

There are two choices:
1. The user chooses the ith coin with value Vi: The opponent either chooses (i+1)th coin or jth coin. The opponent intends to choose the coin which leaves the user with minimum value.
i.e. The user can collect the value Vi + min(F(i+2, j), F(i+1, j-1) )
coinGame1

2. The user chooses the jth coin with value Vj: The opponent either chooses ith coin or (j-1)th coin. The opponent intends to choose the coin which leaves the user with minimum value.
i.e. The user can collect the value Vj + min(F(i+1, j-1), F(i, j-2) )

Recurrence relationship

F(i, j)  ==> represents the maximum value the user can collect from i'th coin to j'th coin.

F(i, j)  = Max(Vi + min(F(i+2, j), F(i+1, j-1)), Vj + min(F(i+1, j-1), F(i, j-2) )) 

Base Cases
    F(i, j)  = Vi           If j == i
    F(i, j)  = max(Vi, Vj)  If j == i+1

Optimal solution

We can memoize the recurrence relationship mentioned above or build an iterative version for the same problem.

Space Complexity: O(n^2)
Time Complexity: O(n^2)
