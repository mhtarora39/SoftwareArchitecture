Let us try to solve this problem for 1, 2 and 3 stairs.
 
Recursive solution

We will denote s(n) as the number of ways to reach nth stair using given stairs, which would be 1, 2 and 3 in our explanation.

We can reach n from n-1, n-2 and n-3 by adding 1 stair of 1, 2 and 3 respectively.
Thus we get the following relationship

s(n) = s(n-1) + s(n-2) + s(n-3)

Base case would be 0. We can reach 0 by only starting there. Thus, s(0) = 1


Optimal solution

We can memoize the recurrence relationship mentioned above or build an iterative version for the same problem.
We can see for any random stair x, s(x) depends on s(y), where y < x. Thus we can iteratively move from 0 to n and at each step we can have
s[x] = s[x-1] + s[x-2] + s[x-3]
and s[n] will be the final answer.


Space Complexity: O(n*length(steps))
Time Complexity: O(n*(length(steps))
