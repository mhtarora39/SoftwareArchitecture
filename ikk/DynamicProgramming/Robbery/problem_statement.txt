Robbery





Problem Statement:

There are n houses built in a line, each of which contains some value in it. A thief is going to steal the maximal value in these houses, but he cannot steal in two adjacent houses because the owner of a stolen house will tell his two neighbors on the left and right side. What is the maximal stolen value?


For example, if there are four houses with values [6, 1, 2, 7], the maximal stolen value is 13 when the first and fourth houses are stolen.
