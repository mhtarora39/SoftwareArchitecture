Levenshtein Distance





Problem Statement:



Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2. (each operation is counted as 1 step.)

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:



a) Insert a character
b) Delete a character
c) Replace a character



e.g. Minimum edit distance between the words 'kitten' and 'sitting', is 3

kitten → sitten (substitution of "s" for "k")
sitten → sittin (substitution of "i" for "e")
sittin → sitting (insertion of "g" at the end)


Input Format:



You will be given two strings strWord1 and strWord2, containing lower case alphabets from a to z.



Output Format:



Return an integer denoting the edit distance between two strings.



Constraints:



1 <= length(strWord1), length(strWord2) <= 1000
