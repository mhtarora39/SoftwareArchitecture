Possible To Achieve Target Sum?

Problem Statement:

Given an array arr of size n and a target sum k. 

You have to determine, whether there exists a group of numbers (numbers need not to be contiguous and group can not be empty) in arr such that their sum equals to k.

Input Format:

There are two argument. First one is arr and second one is k.

Output Format:

Return a boolean denoting your answer.  

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 18
-10^17 <= arr[i], k <= 10^17

Sample Test Cases:

Sample Input 1:

arr = [2 4 8]
k = 6

Sample Output 1:

True

Explanation 1:

arr[0] + arr[1] = 6

Sample Input 2:

arr = [2 4 6]
k = 5

Sample Output 2:

False

Explanation 2:

There does not exists any group such that its sum equals to k.
