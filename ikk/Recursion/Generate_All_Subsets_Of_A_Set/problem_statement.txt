Generate All Subsets Of A Set


Problem Statement:

Given a set (string s containing only distinct lowercase letters ('a' - 'z')), you have to generate ALL possible subsets of it . 

Note that empty set is always a subset of any set.

Input Format:

There is only one argument denoting string s.

Output Format:

Return array of strings containing ALL possible subsets of given string.

You need not to worry about order of strings in your output array. Like for s = "a", arrays ["", "a"] and ["a", ""]  both will be accepted.

Constraints:

0 <= |s| <= 20
s only contains distinct lowercase alphabetical letters ('a' - 'z').
You have to return ALL possible subsets. 

Sample Test Cases:

Sample Input:

"xy" 

Sample Output:

["", "x", "y", "xy"] 

Notes:

Suggested time in interview: 20 minutes
The “Suggested Time” is the time expected to complete this question during a real-life interview, not now in homework i.e. For the first attempt of a given homework problem, the focus should be to understand what the problem is asking, what approach you are using, coding it, as well as identifying any gaps that you can discuss during a TA session. Take your time, but limit yourself to 2 one hour sessions for most problems.
