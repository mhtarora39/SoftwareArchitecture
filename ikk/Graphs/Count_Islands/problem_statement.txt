Count Islands

Problem Statement:

Given a 2D integer matrix of size n * m, containing only 0s and 1s. 

You have to find number islands in that matrix.

An island is a group of connected 1s. Here connected is defined on all the 8 neighbours (4 side neighbours and 4 diagonal neighbours).

Input Format:

There is only one argument denoting the 2D integer matrix of size n * m.

Output Format:

Return an integer denoting the number of islands.

Constraints:

1 <= n, m <= 450
0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 1
Individual 1 (which is not connected to any neighbour) is also considered as an island. 
Do not use visited matrix.
Use as little extra memory as possible.

Sample Test Case:

Sample Input:

matrix = 
[
    [1 1 0 0 0]
    [0 1 0 0 1]
    [1 0 0 1 1]
    [0 0 0 0 0]
    [1 0 1 0 1]
]

Sample Output:

5

Explanation:

(0 0), (0 1), (1 1) and (2 0) makes one island.
(1 4), (2 4) and (2 3) makes one island. 
(4 0) makes one island.
(4 2) makes one island.
(4 4) makes one island.
