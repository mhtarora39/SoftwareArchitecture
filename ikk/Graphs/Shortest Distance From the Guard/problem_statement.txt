Shortest Distance From the Guard





Problem Statement:



You are given a character grid of nxm size. Each element of the Grid is either a GUARD, an OPEN space or a WALL. Every GUARD can move up, down, left and right in the open space. They cannot move on the wall.



Return the distance of every cell from the nearest guard. Return -1 for WALL and unreachable places.



Input Format:



You will be given n strings of length m representing the grid. Each character in the grid will be G, O or W.

G - Guard

O - Open space

W - Wall



Output Format:



Return 2D integer array of size nxm representing the minimum distance from that cell to the nearest guard. Put -1 in case of wall cells and unreachable cells.



Constraints:



1 <= n,m <= 10^3


Sample Test Case:



Sample Input-1:


OOOOG
OWWOO
OOOWO
GWWWO
OOOOG



Sample Output-1:



3 3 2 1 0 
2 -1 -1 2 1 
1 2 3 -1 2 
0 -1 -1 -1 1 
1 2 2 1 0 



Explanation-1:



All the walls are -1. All other cells have the minimum distance to a Guard.



Sample Input-2:


GWOWG



Sample Output-2:



0 -1 -1 -1 0



Explanation-2:



Open space at the middle is unreachable for the guards.
