This is a simple BFS problem.

Have a look at the solution provided by us, it contains necessary comments to understand the solution.





Time Complexity:

O(rows * cols).


Auxiliary Space Used:

O(rows * cols).


Space Complexity:

O(rows * cols). 
Input is O(1) and auxiliary space used is O(rows * cols). So, O(1) + O(rows * cols) -> O(rows * cols).
