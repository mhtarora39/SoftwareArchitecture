To solve this problem simple DFS will work! 

Code provided by will be enough to understand the idea.

Time Complexity:

As we are doing normal DFS time complexity of our solution will be O(V + E). We are given n nodes and also given that it does not contain multiple edges and self loops hence maximum number of edges possible is n * (n - 1). So time complexity will be O(n + n^2) that is O(n^2).

Space complexity:

Given input contains O(n^2) edges and we are also creating new graph with O(n^2) edges hence space complexity will be O(n^2).
