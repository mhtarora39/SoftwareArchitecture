Implement Queue Using Two Stacks

Problem Statement:

Implement a queue Q using exactly two stacks S1 and S2.

As an input you will receive a singly linked list L containing integers values. Denote size of L as N.

When node value of L is negative, you should consider it as a dequeue operation else consider it as an enqueue operation. 

You have to return a singly linked list of dequeued values.

In the case where there is noting left to dequeue and still you see a dequeue operation, add -1.

Input Format:

A singly linked list L of size N.

Output Format:

Return a singly linked list of dequeued values.

Constraints:

-1 <= value of node <= 2 * 10^9
1 <= N <= 10^5
There will be at least one dequeue operation. 

Sample Test Case:

Sample Input:

1 -> -1 -> 2 -> -1 -> -1 -> 3 -> -1 -> NULL

Sample Output:

1 -> 2 -> -1 -> 3 -> NULL

Explanation:

L  -> ans      

1   : NULL
-1 : 1 -> NULL
2  : 1 -> NULL
-1 : 1 -> 2 -> NULL
-1 : 1 -> 2 -> -1 -> NULL       (At this time queue is empty so add -1.)
3  : 1 -> 2 -> -1 -> NULL
-1 : 1 -> 2 -> -1 -> 3 -> NULL
