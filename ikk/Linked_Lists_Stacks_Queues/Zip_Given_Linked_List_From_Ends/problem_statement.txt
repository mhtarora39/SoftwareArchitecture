Zip Given Linked List From Ends


Problem Statement:

Given an integer singly linked list, zip it from its two ends. (Looking at the sample test case will make it more clear.)

You have to do it in-place i.e. in the same linked list, with using only constant extra space. 

Input Format:

There is only one argument in input, denoting integer singly linked list.

Output Format:

Return zipped linked list.

Constraints:

0 <= size of linked list <= 100000 
-2 * 10^9 <= value stored in any node <= 2 * 10^9

Sample Test Case:

Sample Input:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL

Sample Output:

1 -> 6 -> 2 -> 5 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL

(Other modification to try yourself for practice: zip two separate lists and unzip them back into original lists. i.e. unzip(zip(L1, L2)) should return L1 and L2.)
