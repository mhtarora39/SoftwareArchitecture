Answer:
Stack

In recursion, function calls are stacked. 

Consider Tree 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5. When we do dfs, first dfs will be called for 1 then "from that function" it will be called for 2, but before that some information will be stacked so that after finishing dfs(2) computer can know what to do next!
