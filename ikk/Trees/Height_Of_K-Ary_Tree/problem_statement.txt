Height Of K-Ary Tree


Problem Statement:

Given a k-ary tree containing N nodes. You have to find height of the tree. (Length of the longest path from root to any node.)

(We are looking for number of edges on longest path from root to any node, not number of nodes on longest path from root to any node.)

Input Format:

There is only one argument denoting the root of the k-ary tree. 

Output Format:

Return an integer denoting height of the k-ary tree.

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^5
0 <= k <= N - 1
Total there are 30 test cases, out of which 1 test case (test case no. 28) is a degenerate tree (pathological tree) of size 10^5. Due to recursion limit, some languages like javascript and python might not pass it, so don't worry about that. But if you are using C++ or Java then it is expected to pass it.  

Sample Test Case:

Sample Input:

3-ary tree:
1 is the root of the tree.
2's parent is 1.
3's parent is 1.
5's parent is 1.
4's parent is 5.

Sample Output:

2

Explanation:

Given a 3-ary tree with 5 nodes. Node 1 has 3 children 2, 3 and 5, and node 5 has one child 4.
Longest path from root is 1 -> 5 -> 4 and it's length is 2.

Notes:

Total there are 30 test cases, out of which 1 test case (test case no. 027) is a degenerate tree (pathological tree) of size 10^5. Due to recursion limit, some languages like JavaScript, Ruby, Python etc. might not pass it, so don't worry about that. But if you are using C++ or Java then it is expected to pass it.
