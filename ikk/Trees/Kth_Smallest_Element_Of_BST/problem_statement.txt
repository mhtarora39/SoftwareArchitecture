Kth Smallest Element Of BST


Problem Statement:

Given a BST (binary search tree) of size N containing integer elements and an integer k. You have to find kth smallest element of given BST.

Input Format:

There are two arguments in the input. First one is the root of the BST and second one is an integer k.

Output Format:

Return an integer denoting kth smallest element of BST.

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 6000
1 <= k <= N
-2 * 10^9 <= value stored in any node <= 2 * 10^9
BST need not to be balanced.
You are not allowed to alter the structure or data inside the given BST. 

Sample Test Case:

Sample Input:

BST =
2 is the root node.
1 is 2's left child.
3 is 2's right child. 

k = 3

Sample Output:

3

Explanation:

3rd smallest element is 3.

Due to some HackerRank limitations currently we are providing code-stubs only in C, C++, C++ 14, C#, Java 7, Java 8, JavaScript, Python 3 and Swift.

For other languages simply write your solution (no need to read input and write output) assuming that you are given input arguments mentioned in the input format. Your solution will be checked manually. Do not worry about input, output and testcases. Just submit it.
