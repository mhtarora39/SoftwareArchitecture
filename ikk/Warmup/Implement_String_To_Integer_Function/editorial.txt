Have a look at the solution provided by us.







Time Complexity:

O(|s|).
As in worst case (when integer is not present in the string or present at the end of string) we need to iterate over the whole string. 


Auxiliary Space Used:

O(1).


Space Complexity:

O(|s|).
As space complexity includes the input size also.
Note that generally we use Auxiliary Space Used = Space Complexity, but there is a different. Auxiliary space does not count the input size but space complexity does.
