Find The Missing Number


Problem Statement:

You are given an array named nos, containing distinct numbers from 1 to n, except one missing number i.e. size of nos is n - 1. Also given array need not to be sorted. 

You have to find the missing number.

Input Format:

There is only one argument denoting array nos of size n - 1.

Output Format:

Return an integer containing missing number.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5
Given array need not to be sorted.
Given array contains distinct numbers.
Assume that input can not be edited/mutated.
Solution with linear time complexity and constant auxiliary space is expected.

Sample Test Case:

Sample Input:

[4, 1, 2, 6, 5]

Sample Output:

3

Explanation:

Size of given array is 5, hence n = 6.
Numbers from 1 to 6 is present except number 3. So missing number is 3.
