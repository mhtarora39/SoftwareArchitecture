Many solutions to this. All are interview-acceptable.

Boring non-recursive solution: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/print-a-given-matrix-in-spiral-form/

First three solutions here are all excellent: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/726756/print-two-dimensional-array-in-spiral-order

1. Recursive Solution:  Don't do this unless your interviewer explicitly asks you to use Recursion
2. Python Solution: This can be done in any language
3. Tricky, single for-loop solution: This is just clever






Input format in problem statement describes the input format to the particular function, not the actual programme. They might be different. So, input format to the actual programme is:


First line contains one integer denoting rows in the matrix.
Second line contains one integer denoting columns in the matrix.
Next rows lines contains actual values in matrix. Each line contains space separated columns number of characters, makng one row of the matrix.
