Optimal solution
Optimal solution will be to use two maps, one to maintain the count and other one to maintain max value.
For every entry you get, you increment the count to the corresponding key and put maximum of the current value and the value corresponding to that key in the map.

Note:
Comparing two string with length N is O(N) operation.

Space Complexity: O(n*(MAX_LENGTH(KEYS)+MAX_LENGTH(VALUES)))
Time Complexity: O(n*(MAX_LENGTH(VALUE))
