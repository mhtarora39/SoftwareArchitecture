Problem Statement:

The input data is stored in a file and consists of key-value pairs. Compute, for each key, the number of values with that key and the value with the highest lexicographical sort order.



Input Format:

You will be given one String array of size N containing KEYS and VALUES separated by space.



Output Format:

Return a String array with an entry for each key. Each entry should contain key, number of values corresponding to that key and value with the highest lexicographical sort order in the given format.

KEY:COUNT,MAX_VALUE



Order of the output does not matter.
Keys and values will contain small letters and numerics.


Constraints:

1 <= N <= 10^4
1 <= Length(KEYS) <= 256
1 <= Length(VALUES) <= 800 



Sample Test Case:

Sample Input-1:

arr = [ “key1 abcd”,
            “key2 zzz”,
            “key1 hello”,
            “key3 world”,

            "key1 hello"]

Sample Output-1:

key1:3,hello
key2:1,zzz
key3:1,world



Sample Input-2:

arr = [ “mark zuckerberg”,

            “tim cook”,

            “mark twain”];

Sample Output-2:

mark:2,zuckerberg
tim:1,cook
