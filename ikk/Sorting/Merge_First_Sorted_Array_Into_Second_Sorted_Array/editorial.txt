We are allowed to use only constant extra space. 

We can start merging from the end. (Or we can first create empty space at the beginning instead of the end by copying arr2[i] to arr2[n + i] for i from 0 to n - 1, and then start merging from the beginning. But this will add one more loop unnecessarily.)

Have a look at the solution provided by us. 






Time Complexity:

O(n) as we are traversing through the arr1 and arr2 only once.

Auxiliary Space Used:

O(1).

Space Complexity:

O(n) due to input size.
