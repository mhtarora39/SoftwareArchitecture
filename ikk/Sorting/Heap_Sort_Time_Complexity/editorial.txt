Ans:

O(N * Log(N)).

In heap sort we first build max heap(or min heap). This will take O(N) time. (Yes, O(N) not O(N * Log(N))!)

Then O(N) times we will extract max element(or min element) and call max heapify(or min heapify) functin that is O(Log N). So, this step will take O(N * Log(N)) time.

So, overall time complexity will be O(N + N Log(N)) that is O(N * Log(N)).
