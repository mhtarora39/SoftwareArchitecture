Group the numbers

Problem Statement:

You are given an array of positive integers only. Group them in-place into evens and odds in such a way that all evens appear on the left side and all odds on the right side. 

Input Format:

Integer array
Positive integers only
Repeats possible.

Output Format:

Return the same integer array, with evens on left side and odds on the right side. There is no need to preserve order within odds or within evens.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5
Given array may contains duplicate numbers.
Solution with linear time complexity and constant auxiliary space is expected.

Sample Test Case:

Sample Input:

[1, 2, 3, 4]

Sample Output:

[4, 2, 1, 3]

Explanation:

Order does not matter. Other valid solution are
[2, 4, 1, 3]
[2, 4, 3, 1]
[4, 2, 3, 1]
