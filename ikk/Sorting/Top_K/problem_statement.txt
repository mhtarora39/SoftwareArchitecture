Top K

Problem Statement:

You are given an array of integers which is analogous to a continuous stream of input. Find K largest elements from a given stream of numbers. By definition, we don't know the size of the input stream. Hence produce K largest elements seen so far, at any given time. For repeated numbers, return them only once.

If there are less than K unique elements, return all of them.

Note:
* Represent input stream as an array. Don't rely on its size.
* Feel free to use built-in functions if you need a specific data-structure.

Input Format:

Integer array
Repeats possible
Input may or may not be sorted

Output Format:

Return an integer array containing K largest elements. If there are less than K unique elements, return all of them.
Order of output does not matter.

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 10^5
1 <= k <= 10^5
Given array may contains duplicate numbers.

Sample Test Case:

Sample Input-1:

arr = [1, 5, 4, 4, 2]; k = 2

Sample Output-1:

[4, 5]

Sample Input-2:

arr = [1, 5, 1, 5, 1]; k = 3

Sample Output-2:

[5, 1]
