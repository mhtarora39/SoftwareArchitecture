We need to preserve the order of elements in a sorted manner. If we can do that, we can obtain top K elements. Also, if an element is smaller than the last element in top k, then that element can be dropped as we are not deleting elements.

We can maintain a balanced BST or a sorted set collection. Keep adding new elements to the sorted set and if the size of the tree increases more than k, remove the smallest element.

Time Complexity: O(N*log(K))
Space Complexity: O(K)
