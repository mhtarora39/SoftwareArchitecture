Answer: Heap Sort and Quick Sort.

Suppose our data is in terms of {key, value} pair and we want to sort only on the basic of key.

Consider the below example:

[{2, c}, {1, b}, {1, a}]

Then merge is gauranteed to return 

[{1, b}, {1, a}, {2, c}]

Note that in input array {1, b} comes before {1, a} and in the output array also the "order is preserved" when key value is same!

But in standard implementation of Quick Sort and Heap Sort it is not guaranteed!

Quick Sort and Heap Sort may return: 

[{1, a}, {1, b}, {2, c}]

With some modifications we can make Quick Sort and Heap Sort stable!
