Detect Prime Numbers


Problem Statement:

Given an integer array a of size N. For each integer in a we have to check if it is a prime number or not.

Input Format:

There is only one argument denoting integer array a.

Output Format:

Return a string of size N, where ith character of string contains '1' if a[i] is a prime number else it should contain '0'. (1 is neither a prime nor a composite number, hence according to the previous statement, it should go in else part, i.e. ith character should contain '0', when a[i] = 1.)

Constraints:

1 <= a[i] <= 4 * 10^6
1 <= N <= 3 * 10^5

Sample Test Case:

Sample Input:

[6, 2, 5, 8]

Sample Output:

0110

Explanation:

6 is not a prime number. (6 = 2 * 3)
2 is a prime number.
5 is a prime number.
8 is not a prime number. (8 = 2 * 4)
