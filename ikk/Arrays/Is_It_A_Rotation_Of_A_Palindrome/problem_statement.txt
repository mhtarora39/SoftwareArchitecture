Is It A Rotation Of A Palindrome?


Problem Statement:

Given a string s of length N containing only lower case letters (a - z), we have to check if it is a rotation of some palindromic string or not.

Input Format:

There is only one argument denoting string s.

Output Format:

Return one integer. Return 1 if given string s is a rotation of some palindromic string else return 0.  

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 4000
s will only contain lower case letters (a - z).
String may or may not be sorted.

Sample Test Case:

Sample Input:

aab

Sample Output:

1

Explanation:

Given string aab is a rotation of palindromic string aba. Right rotation on aba will give aab. 

Notes:

Expected solution is O(N ^ 2). That will be very easy to write in an interview.

Maximum time allowed in interview: 20 Minutes. 

Python: If getting run time error then try to use iterative version to check if string is a palindrome or not.
