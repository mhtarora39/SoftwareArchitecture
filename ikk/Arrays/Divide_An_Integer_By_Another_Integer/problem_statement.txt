Problem Statement:

Given two integers a and b. You have to find quotient q, when a is divided by b. 

Input Format:

Two integers a and b.

Output Format:

Quotient q of a / b.

Constraints:

-10^18 <= a, b <= 10^18
b != 0

You are not allowed to use multiplication (*) operator.
You are not allowed to use mod (%) operator.

Sample Test Case:

Sample Input:

a = 5, b = 2

Sample Output:
