## Compoent 

Small building block of Archotecture

## Types Of Architecture 

1. **Layer Architecture**
```
* Build out of layer ( i.e Tcp IP)
  a. **Layer is closed (issue)** ( We can't send or access layer directly )
  b. Layer of isolation (Each layer is component and binded each other by interfac     e. No effect on any other layer if any underlaying layer change)
  c. Sepration of concerns.
  d. Architect decide which layer needs to open.
  e. Open layer interoduce cross layer concerns.

ToDo add image.

### Layer Architecture Concerns

* Good General Architecture 
* Sink Hole : Whach out for architecture sinkhole anti-pattren.
* Tands to land at monolythic.

### Analysis 

 1. Overall Agility  Low Score
 2. Deployment ( Low )
 3. Testability ( Good )
 4. Performance ( Law )
 5. Scalability ( Low )
 6. Development ( Good )
 9. Complexity  ( Good )
10. Loose Coupling ( Low )
